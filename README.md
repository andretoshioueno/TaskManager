# TaskManager
This is a task manager developed for 8-bit microcontrollers.

- TaskMgr.X: this task manager was developed for using on PIC16F628A (8-bits PIC), but it can be easily used in another 8-bit PICs.
  It was compiled with XC8 compiler v1.34. As IDE, it was used MPLAB X IDE v3.15. 
- ExTaskMgr: example (using PIC 16F628A, 8-bits PIC) using task manager. Simulation (Proteus) included.
  It was compiled with XC8 compiler v1.34. As IDE, it was used MPLAB X IDE v3.15.
- TaskManagerArduino: includes the task manager (for Arduino) and a example of a application.  
- TaskManager_Renesas_RX63N: Task Manager (for RenesasÂ´ RX63N microcontroller). In this project, task manager and example of its use are together.
