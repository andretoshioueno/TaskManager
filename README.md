# TaskManager
This is a task manager developed for 8-bit microcontrollers.

- TaskMgr.X: this task manager was developed for using on PIC16F628A (8-bits PIC), but it can be easily used in another 8-bit PICs.
- ExTaskMgr: example (using PIC 16F628A, 8-bits PIC) using task manager. Simulation (Proteus) included.

This repository also contains examples of task managerÂ´s use.
